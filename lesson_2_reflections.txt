What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Identifies the directory as a git trackable directory. Adds the hidden git direcory. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  It holds files that will trackable in git. Not all files needs to be tracked for changes.
  This reduces clutter in the git repository. You can control what changes or file with changes
  to commit. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  This allows only files with common logical changes to be committed, even if there are
  other files with changes but not logically related.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  Epxeriments, new features, explore options - allows to take risk in experimentation.

How do the diagrams hekp you visualize the branch structure?

  I helps me see the relationships between commits and branches as well as it's unidirectional
  parents.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

  All changes that existed on the two separate branches are combined.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

  Pross - I don't have to do all the work myself. Cons - it could cuase unwanted merging of 
  possible code conflicts and introduce a bug. Doing it all manually is tedious, especially
  for easy lines to merge. A way to only identify items that's hard to merge is a good thing,
  in this way most of the work is already handlke automatically.
